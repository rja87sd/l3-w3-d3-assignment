# Objective  
- Combine React Bootstrap's component-based design with the utility-first CSS approach of Tailwind CSS to create a modern, responsive landing page. This assignment challenges you to leverage both frameworks within a Next.js project to construct a page that not only looks great but also scales well across devices. Additionally, deploy your finished product to Netlify to share your work with the world.

# Instructions  
## Part 1: Project Setup  
### Initialize a Next.js Application:  
  
- Use create-next-app to kickstart your project. Ensure Node.js is up-to-date on your system.
  
### Install Dependencies:  
  
- Run npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap to add React Bootstrap to your project.
  
### Global Styles Configuration:  
  
- Import Bootstrap's CSS in your src/app/layout.js file to ensure global availability.
- Set up Tailwind by creating its config files and importing the base styles as recommended in the Tailwind CSS documentation.

- Deploy your Next.js application to Netlify. Link your project's GitHub repository to Netlify and follow the steps to deploy.
## Part 5: Documentation  
### README.md Update:  
- Clearly document the purpose of your project, the steps you took to implement the features, and any challenges you faced.
### Include Deployment URL:  
- Provide the Netlify URL of your deployed landing page in the README.md.
